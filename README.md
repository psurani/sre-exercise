Overview
This exercise demonstrates the use of CI/CD tooling.

As the task is open-ended, it leaves you with quite a few decisions to make.

The end result and the way to get there can be very simple or it can be very complex, depending on how you approach it.

Please note, the choice of application/service is not as important as the choice of tooling and automation itself.

Enjoy!

Goal
Design and implement a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests and deploys either a single-page web application or REST API.

Criteria
Pipeline should be described in a file (e.g. .gitlab-ci.yml in GitLab)
Any required infrastructure should be defined as code using either Terraform or CloudFormation
Provide web application/API endpoint URL
Provide source code of the solution so we can easily reproduce it in our environment
Optional
Provide documentation and diagram for the proposed solution
Write a simple app/service of your own
Technologies
Use free version of CI/CD tools (e.g. GitLab, CircleCI, Travis CI etc.)
Use any open source application/service written in any language
Use AWS Free Tier if cloud resources are required
